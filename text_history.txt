
hi friends happy Wednesday or Thursday if you're watching over on YouTube hey how are you doing I hope you're having a wonderful day so far my name is Bailey seran and this is the dark History Podcast whew I need a theme song for dark history don't I'm anywho I'm here to talk about some dark ass history that we never learned in school or I should at least say that I never learned in school if you're new here hi welcome come take a seat by me don't be shy if you're
and learning about people and events that your history books didn't cover in school the maybe should have then you'll fit in right in here with us okay look today's story it's uncomfortable okay it's heartbreaking it's just it's set it's awful it's sad there's those are all the words I can think of it just doesn't make any sense but with all of that being said there's really like no sugarcoating this this is what happened and it's when more honest and when we're transparent that we can learn and grow together you know
 but most of all not let history repeat itself
 so let's set the scene it's New Years Day 1923 and many people are waking up from celebrating the New Year some of them are still wearing a flapper dress or a suit tired from dancing the night away in a jazz club or maybe they're hung over from buying illegal drinks at a speakeasy yes oh yes it was still illegal to buy alcohol wild right of course though that was more of like the upscale City Vibe if you were in the country had little less
 pocket change to spend or were to straightedge to visit like those kind of illegal joints then you probably had a quieter evening of staying at home and ringing in the new year with with your loved ones you know now 1923 in general President Warren G Harding would die in office the Yankee Stadium would be built in the Bronx and the original Hollywood sign would be built oh yeah Hollywood was originally called Hollywood land but we could say that for another episode babe
 before all of that on the morning of January first nineteen twenty three thirty year old James and his 22-year old wife Fanny Taylor woke up at a home and a town called Sumner a neighboring community of Rosewood Florida that morning James Taylor goes to work like he did any other day but while James was at work something happens to his wife Fanny that boy it just triggers a domino effect a horrific domino effect it leads to the
 murders of innocent people the destruction of a town and the displacement of an entire Community changing Rosewood forever who just sounds traumatic I know because it is welcome hi this episode friends were going to be talking about the Rosewood Massacre have you heard of it
 yeah exactly exactly I didn't this one just it completely blew my mind is like why in the Waldo did we not learned about this in school correction I can only speak for myself here so why in the Waldo did my history books not teach this Rosewood Massacre yeah it happened let's discuss and learn together what took place in 1923 Rosewood Florida buckling kitty cats this is just what yeah I'm great with words obviously that's why I started a podcast the beginning great place
 start the town of Rosewood was established in the mid eighteen hundreds white families had moved here prior to the Civil War and black landowner started to move in in the 1870s it's located in the State of Florida and it's just nine miles east of the Gulf of Mexico the name Rosewood it came from the red cedar trees that were all over the land there fun fact alert Boo Boo Boo did you know that when you cut open a red cedar tree the cedar has a pale pink color inside
 yeah I guess it's like super pretty super beautiful but did you also know that if you cut me open I've got a little pink inside a LOL anyways so they called the town Rosewood after the pink color okay nice right well as we've learned through history we can't have nice things so when people saw the really pretty color that was inside of these beautiful incredible trees what do you think they did yes they cut them all down they cut them down and they sold the
 a now because of this they made a pretty decent amount of money and it supported the economy of the town but still you know sad for the trees by the year 1886 the town had developed quite a bit it had its own post office a Schoolhouse and they were three churches one for the white people into for the black people remember we're talking about a time that's very much a segregated America so four years later in 1890 the town began to hit some hard times
 all the red cedar trees had been chopped down and without the trees there's no money to be made which in turn leads to the town's economic decline because of the loss of income and not many available jobs many members of the white Community left Rosewood and headed to the nearby town of Sumner Sumner was appealing because there was a large Sawmill which provided tons of jobs and right now the people needed work so sign me up for Sumner you know so by the
 1900 the Rosewood population have now shifted to a majority black community now with in Rosewood there was a really close sense of community like everyone seemed to know one another and looked out for one another as well I mean rarely did anyone need to leave town like to travel for food or for things they may need because they had almost everything right there with in Rosewood in addition to the three churches Schoolhouse and post office Rosewood also had a train station
 in which will become important later a general store and a Sugar Mill plus if you were looking for some fun they even had a Rosewood baseball team what I'm getting at is Rosewood was overall just a nice place so for over 20 years the people of rosewood's stayed with in Rosewood and the people of Sumner the neighboring town they stayed within Sumner they coexisted they had their own Communities going on and they were just doing their own thing but unfortunately that peaceful time was about
 to end because some shit was a bruin but before we get into what was a bruin let's pause for a word from our sponsor things are kind of getting back to normal I guess right yeah but I swear to you over quarantine my brain has felt like mush and need some exercise I mean it is a muscle right you know any who would best fiends it feels like my brain got a great workout what's best fiends you ask well it's the mobile puzzle game that will put

 and Fanny Taylor who are white are waking up on the first day of the new year and James was like goodbye Fanny like I'm off to work I love you babe you know and Fanny is like oh my God yeah have a good day whenever that's probably what they did anyway so James leaves his wife Fanny home alone because he has to go to work he works at The Sawmill in Sumner which was about one mile east of Rosewood now while James is at work Milling saws Fanny whose back at home
 rumor had it someone had attacked her oh yeah oh yeah the neighbors heard screams they heard screams coming from within the Taylor's home and they were like oh my God you know like what's going on screaming hmm so for you and I we'd probably go and like check it out right would be like oh my God they're screaming are you okay but for Fanny's neighbors they heard the screams and then they just left it alone great yeah awesome so some time goes by and James comes home from
 Mark and when he gets home he sees that fanny has a big bruise on her face it's clear that somebody had hit her pretty badly so he asked her you know who did this to you and Fanny tells him that a black man assaulted her she's like I don't know who it was but it was definitely a black man according to Fanny hmm I mean this could be possible this guy came in randomly beat her I guess in her own house but remember
 like this is a small town in fact both Sumner and Rosewood were so small that most people recognize one another so
 are you sure we honey are you sure that's what you saw Fanny the fact that Fanny like could not name the person who attacked her that should have been the first red flag okay that maybe this person that quote unquote attacked her was not a resident from Rosewood I'm telling you I'm not kidding you if you lived in Rosewood you would know your neighbors everybody knew each other but Fanny would most likely know this person because again the likelihood of her not knowing is presumptive not
 so sure Fanny sure again because it's a 1920s unfortunately this is a time when a white woman made bold claims of being attacked by a black person nobody questioned it they just believed it to be true so they didn't question Fanny story for one second like oh my God she was beaten by a block man like we are so angry and nobody wanted to like double check and make sure she what you she wasn't lying they just
 just went with it people are talking with in Rose Water okay and this story about Fanny gets back to a woman by the name of Sarah carrier and she's like wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute that's not true Sarah said that she was at the Taylor's Home the morning of that so-called attack and not just that but her granddaughter was there with her and neither of them saw black man attack Fanny
 alone even enter their house well you're probably wondering really Who the hell's Sarah okay well Sarah she had been working for the Tailor's for quite some time she was there that day with her granddaughter doing the Taylor's laundry now Sarah said that she actually saw a white man leaving the Taylor house that morning she said she never saw a black man come by the house all day now get this get this
 Sarah recognize this white man she had seen him come by the house once or twice before hmm
 Sarah had believed that this man and Fanny were having some kind of Winky dinky if you're not on me Sarah said that this man was actually the guy that beat Fanny that morning and that she was just lying to cover her ass because she's probably having an affair and she doesn't want people to know
 Fanny so Sarah's version is now going around town it's spreading like wildfire within the black community they all 100% believed her why would she lie whoa why would she lie unfortunately though the white voices were louder within the community and made it very clear that Fanny was quote not a liar she was telling the truth okay
 I freaking roll right it gets a lot more traumatic talking amongst the accusers and name comes up Jesse Hunter and they think they're disgusting they're like hey Jesse Hunter this is our guy this is the guy who did it who's Jesse Hunter okay now Jesse Hunter was a black man who recently escaped from the nearby prison now because Jesse was a black man who recently escaped from prison while they're believing he must have done it must be the same black man that attacked Fanny no
 sarcasm mind you there was absolutely 100% zero evidence that Jesse was the perpetrator but that doesn't matter to them they've got their minds set on Jesse Hunter and they go out looking for him while out looking for him the county sheriff Robert Walker he joins in on the search now this County Sheriff was able to get a bunch of other white men together to form what was called a posse to help with the search now this isn't like your normal Posse today like a
 up of friends hanging out back then a posse was a more formal thing it was an official group of men that a sheriff could organize in case of an emergency and this to them at the time well this was that kind of Emergency the sheriff would pull in some guys from around town I don't know how he picked them but he did and he made them his temporary deputies which is wild to think just ran it like hey you your Deputy now like
 that's you were allowed to do that so the county sheriff got the Posse together and they start searching for Jesse now they were determined to catch him and punish him for his alleged attack towards Fanny the Posse even went down to the local prison to borrow a pack of bloodhounds to track Jesse sent I mean they were seeing red no common sense going on here the Posse they hear that Jesse was last seen with another black man named Sam Carter who worked as the local blacksmith
 now this alleged sighting has never been confirmed but they don't care now remember again I've said it 100 times it's a small town so they know exactly where Sam Carter lives and they had straight to his house they barged in okay and they interrogated Sam and Iceland where's Jesse and they're demanding and they're like where's Jesse we need to know where he is right now where is he going where's Jesse but Sam he couldn't answer their questions because
 yeah he didn't have the answers you know he doesn't know he has no idea what's going on of course the Posse doesn't believe him they were convinced that Sam he knew something okay because they are convinced of this they get swept up in what becomes this angry mob mentality so they force a man of the house the kidnap him the posses thought process was that if they torture Sam like they can probably get some answers as to where Jesse is so
 the kidnaps him they hung him from a tree by his neck pushing Sam to tell the quote-unquote truth hmm Sam he was telling the truth the whole time he didn't know where Jesse was but that's not acceptable to the Posse they're hell-bent on their mission of quote-unquote Justice they shot him to death and left his body in the road between Rosewood and Sumner Sam Carter was only 45 years
 sold this is just the tip of the iceberg so by that night the original Posse which was you know it was just a small at first oh babe babe we had now snowballed into a freaking mob oh yeah people were talking and the neighboring towns got word about like what had taken place and that this Manhunt for Jesse was going down so a bunch of rando white men come out of the freaking would work it was like we're we're
 you guys come from they just showed up there was no official count of how many men joined this Riot but that's exactly what it turns into a freaking Riot and this is when the massacre begins I know this is a little heavy we're just going to take a little moment here break for a sponsor that helps keep dark history going get mouth-watering seasonal recipes and fresh pre-measured ingredients delivered right to your door with hello fresh which is

 the Rosewood Massacre the Posse is still out searching for Jesse Hunter remember the prison escapee who the mob believed beat Fanny but now but now the Posse searching for Jesse it's it's grown bigger and bigger and more white men are joining this mob from all over Florida because his mom had grown to like such a big a big site members of the community families both black and white
 you could sense that things were getting out of control violence was a bruin and this no longer feels like it was just a search for Jesse 9A it was turning more aggressive angry hate-filled as this white mob was Now using this as an excuse to destroy everything in sight so the black community is terrified by what they're seeing happening in their own town of Rosewood they thought that maybe if they got together in a large group
 and like some of their homes they would be safety in large numbers protecting them so they did that a couple of days go by and on day three there's another rumor spreading around that Jesse was actually hiding in one of the homes that they missed back in Rosewood and the home was none other than Sarah carriers house to remember Sarah carrier from earlier she's the one that who did the laundry for the tailors who told the truth who had the
 L story Sarah yeah Sarah son Sylvester carrier he also lived in the house with her now there was some tension between Sylvester and the people of the white Community because he was known for speaking up for himself and protecting the women in his family which I know what's wrong with that there's absolutely nothing good for him good for him I know I agree with you but again this is the 1920s it wasn't smart won't go smart
 just stand up for yourself or others towards white person unless you wanted some issues so with all that being said it's kind of not surprising when the Posse looked at Sylvester as their next Target now in addition to this angry mob coming their way Sylvester and Sarah also had another problem they were keeping a lot of children from the community within their home although the exact number wasn't known
 you see their home was close to a swamp which in turn made a great location to hide because it provided cover and it wasn't easy to walk around in making it hard to be followed or even get caught unfortunately the swamp would come to be their best protection on the fourth day of this Riot January 4th the white mob is headed for the carrier home it's a Wester wasn't going to just hide and do nothing he was going to defend himself his family the children
 in his property and it was about to get violent when the mob gets to the carrier's house the first thing they do I'm sorry but they shoot the carrier's dog I know they just like freaking shoot the dog one of the guys in the mob he calls out to Sylvester he's like hey come out here and present yourself that come face us so some time goes by and they're getting no response so now they're frustrated they're pissed off to of the white men from the
 they decide to walk up onto the porch and start kicking down the front door these two men were Henry Andrews and Polly Wilkerson and it's Wilkerson who ends up kicking in the front door so inside of the home was Sylvester and Sarah amongst the children there was a nine-year-old girl named Minnie Lee Mitchell Langley she said that Sylvester saved her that day many recalled when Sylvester put her in a safe spot under the stairway while
 they got ready to fight she also said that he got behind her at one point put a gun on her shoulder pointing it at the front door and waited for poly Wilkerson to kick the door down and when Paulie finally kicked that door down Sylvester started shooting to defend themselves they would end up killing both Andrews and Wilkerson
 great you know good can I see that why did but listen once the mob realized that Andrews and Wilkerson were shot and killed it was not good they were raging okay they were livid they were fuming and a gunfight then ensued sadly Sarah carrier and her son Sylvester in the middle of this Crossfire were both tragically murdered the mob keeps shooting and they don't freaking
 who they're hitting the only reason they eventually stopped firing was because they ran out of bullets great now we don't know how many men women and children hiding in the house was Sarah and Sylvester survived if any but what we do know is that the ones who were able to sneak out of the house they went and they hid in the swamp they escaped but not before they saw things that they wouldn't ever forget one of the children are net Goings
 has spoke later about their struggle to escape going said he remembers some staying out for two or three long January nights in the cold swamp scared for their lives but after days of waiting they were able to escape the mob now the guys in the mob are pumped with adrenaline and anger and they are ready to cause more destruction they decided to set fire across several houses and a church on their way back home so this was no longer about Fanny or
 I see this was just a mission to destroy any property owned by the black community in Rosewood and the surrounding areas with the mob on the move the black people living in Rosewood began to flee the town in a hurry they knew that the mob would be coming back wanting revenge for the murder of Andrews and Wilkerson they weren't going to just let that go so many head in the cover of the swamp like the kids did thinking it would be hard to find them or catch them in there
 with in Rosewood lived a man named John right now John Wright was well known within the black community he was a white man but he was friendly to his neighbor's again this is a different time period right and John he wanted to help protect them in their time of need he's seeing out his window what's going down in Rosewood and he wants to open up his store and help the community these are his neighbor's his friends his family he can't just sit back and watch it because John was white the mob
 even think about burning down his house no no they did not they were like nope he's white he's good save his house but burn all these over here there were also white families in Sumner who sheltered and protected people who they knew often people who worked for them Friday morning on January 5th 1923 it's now day five of the Rosewood Massacre things have been pretty bad so far but shits about to get even more real two hundred armed White
 men comes storming into Rosewood and they're coming from all over the state to be a part of this action with those two hundred armed white men some are even members of the Klu Klux Klan as you can probably imagine this is not good this is very bad why are they even here how did they get he's like why are they here what are they doing here there isn't even much information as to how these guys knew what was going on but what we do know is that they showed up so the group it's
 a lot larger right and they were causing way more damage and destruction they burned more homes they burn the second Church the Masonic lodge and the schoolhouse they even burned the baseball field to just everything complete and utter destruction everything is gone except John Wright's house so at this point it's hard to know how many black residents are still left in their Town those who could they ran for the swamp but
 only those who were too old or sick to run they were trapped there and the members of the mob shot them on site such as Lexi Gordon she was a Rosewood resident she ran from her burning home that day trying to escape when she was shot in the back and killed not just killed she was murdered the same day a man named Mingo Williams was also murdered he was shot in the head he wasn't even from Rosewood he was literally just in the wrong
 place at the wrong time Mingo was the seventh recorded person to die in Rosewood so far there's Sam Carter Sylvester carrier his mother Sarah Lexi garden and now Mingo Williams who are killed by the mob murdered by the mob and then there's Henry Andrews and Polly Wilkerson who were killed while storming the carrier house so in the early hours of day 6 it's around 4 a.m. some help finally comes for
 oh those who were trying to escape destruction by this time word got out about what was going on in Rosewood and everybody was talking about it right Brothers John and William Bryce also got word about what was taking place in Rosewood I know I know I know I don't know what's a lot of names I'm throwing at you but who are John and William Bryce okay well they they worked as train conductors who happen to pass through the Rosewood train station all of the time and the Rosewood train station was one of the
 only things that wasn't burned down so when they found out what was happening taken place what was going down in Rosewood they knew that they had to help out their community so the brothers pulled their train into the station to allow women and children who had been hiding in the swamp hop on the train and get the heck out of Rosewood as fast as they could with a train full of people the brace Brothers stopped in different cities along the Route allowing the survivors to get off the train
 rain and attempt to begin their lives again and a new city they had left everything behind they escaped near death and now they were forced to live in fear and never return to their homes and Rosewood again to this day some of the victims descendants still live in the nearby towns that they went to like Gainesville Florida now let's take a little pause for a break Squarespace empowers millions of dreamers makers and

 anywhere he 6 1923 this is the Sixth and final day of the Rosewood Massacre the angry Posse turned mobs that had burned most of Rosewood and left a path of destruction in its wake was Now setting out to finish what they started they wanted to burn down any property left and kill any black residents who had not escaped so they come across James carrier on the road James was Sarah's brother and
 Esther's uncle and he was partially paralyzed from a stroke while Sarah and Sylvester had briefly held down the fort during the attack he had escaped with the children and had also hidden with them in the swamp after it seemed like you know the danger might have passed so he gets up and he leaves the swamp hoping to return to his home and just kind of figure it out from there right but unfortunately James he wouldn't make it some members of the mob they surrounded him
 they marched him to the local Cemetery where they then shot and murdered him right next to the fresh Graves of Sarah and Sylvester I know I know this is awful I know I know I know after the murder of James the mob just kept setting fire to all the homes and buildings until literally there's nothing left Rosewood was completely wiped it was destroyed it was gone without
 that being said what we know for sure is that at least eight people died during the Rosewood Massacre but what hasn't been recorded as the trauma on the community for decades to come and I should add it's believed that there are a lot more victims than just ate but there are eight like on record so a few weeks go by and in February of 1923 somebody somebody finally speaks up and they're like hey
 something just happened over here that maybe we should talk about so they bring it to the attention of a grand jury the way a grand jury worked at least back then was that a prosecutor presents a case to a group of citizens and they can ask questions and investigate the situation and they get to decide if they think anyone should be charged with a crime it sounds pretty fair right the it's the thought of it the idea of it sounds pretty fair but in 1923 and fortunately this jury
 it's been all white so I'm surprised when they didn't see anything wrong with what had taken place in Rosewood and they chose not to press any charges no one involved in the massacre was found guilty of a crime in fact to make things even worse no one was even arrested for these murders it took until the 1931 case of the Scottsboro boys for any kind of solid law push back
 to stop black people from being excluded from being jurors this case which involved nine black teenagers accused of allegedly raping a white woman had not just one trial but his series with all kinds of reversals dismissals retrials I mean it lasted over two decades just this whole thing is a wild story again we're definitely going to have to do it for another time but after it was discovered that there were no black people in the jury records there were name
 that had been forged to make it look like there was AKA they lied they forged them you get them saying you get it once they realize that the names had been forged did the Supreme Court say the Alabama jury selection process was unconstitutional because it was all white and exclude black people on purpose this of course didn't get rid of the all-white juries but it was a start and that's important because in Florida
 a all-white juries were 16 percent more likely to convict black defendants than white defendants and that's not looking good when you are looking for a fair trial Fair trial like come on you guys no but besides all of that the cherry on top of this whole story all the records relating to the Rosewood Massacre we're lost
 gone poof disappeared internal records after what happened yeah no don't there so there's no records there's no records as to what took place in Rosewood the only way we were able to tell this story of history is By Word of Mouth now we're going to pause for a break this summer is showing welcoming signs of a more normal life ahead finally you can get back to enjoying the little things in life like smiling at your

 you'll never have to go to the post office again stamps.com baby wink a big thank you to stamps.com for partnering with me on today's episode for the survivors of the Rosewood Massacre the fear from that day it lingered okay as I said before many relocated to other towns in Florida and none of them would end up returning to live and Rosewood some of the victims even went as far as changing their names when they moved because they were afraid
 read that the people in the mob they weren't going to stop looking for them they were going to continue to hunt them down until they killed them so the survivors the people of Rosewood they were living in constant fear you know they're always watching their back thinking these guys are going to come for them and I think we can both agree that's no way to live Arnett dr. Sarah carriers great-grandson said that within the family home there was like a strict set of rules that nobody brought
 caught up the massacre nobody talked about it unless the elders brought it up you just did it on top of that many of those who participated in the mob were still alive and Arnett he recalled that his mother she knew some of them by their name it was just psychological trauma and fear that would be passed on throughout these families for generations to come the stories from that day lived on within the black community not forgiven
 definitely not forgotten there's a saying that those who forget history are doomed to repeat it so while the story was not widely broadcasted there are those who made it a mission to make sure that this massacre did not slip away or be forgotten in the sands of time even without that the fear and the trauma from this period would affect the survivors lives forever aside from the emotional scars the pain the morning the fear there was a huge
 huge loss of property and wealth which okay I know what you're thinking like property and wealth is nothing in comparison to losing loved ones but it was what they had to pass down to their children or to their families and because the people in Rosewood they weren't millionaires you know they owned their own businesses houses and their own land that's what they had that's what they hatch their names all of that was taken from them and burnt to the ground they weren't just robbed of the land or
 structures they were robbed of leaving their legacies and their chance to leave what they built to their children so and you're not miss hearing me with this next sentence 71 years ago by yes 71 years go by finally the Rosewood Massacre would properly I'm saying that sarcastically be acknowledged so the survivors they received some money if they could prove that they were direct descendants of Rosewood property owners
 these checks are little more than insult to injury and some were as little as $100 or less which is like avocado thanks this was actually the first bill in the United States that compensated the black community for our past racial Injustice the Black and Hispanic caucus has or groups of lawmakers they pushed hard to get this recognition in 2020 yeah you heard me right 20/20 babe the state of
 for dessert a scholarship for the direct descendants it would only pay for some of the students to attend college but Florida also put together a formal commission which would be dedicated to researching the history of this tragedy not only that it would allow the descendants to share their stories in their own words and their voices could finally be heard so you're probably wondering like what happened to Fanny there's no record that Fanny ever came clean about the lie that she spread Fanny never
 I told the truth Penny got something to say let us know watch what remains of Rosewood today maybe like there's a big Monument you know where you can show your respects to or something you know well for small town that once had about like give or take 300 people living in it most people have since left and gone to different communities in the surrounding area and again when we said they never came back they never came back there's only one house left standing in rows
 and guess whose house that is John Wright's house yeah him John right remember he was the man who opened his door to the community as a safe house his house is still there I'm getting I'm laughing because ain't that some shit you know like wow you would think this would be some kind of historical monument in Rosewood right right you would think that right you did that right well in 2020 so again last year the house it was actually up for sale and it was sold to some random
 Mass family in 2020 which is totally fine like you're totally thought yeah but like aren't you surprised that this this house is in a monument or anything yeah like maybe protected by the state because it's all that's left of Rosewood you would think right it's what's left of the Rosewood Massacre you think it would be considered a historical monument or right okay great we're on the same page I'm glad you agree well the Rosewood Heritage Foundation they've tried to reach out to
 the family who moved into John Wright's home but they haven't heard any response the future of this historical home it remains unclear I just this moment in history is just awful right unfortunately though it's kind of familiar it sounds a lot like the Tulsa Race Massacre the Tulsa Race Massacre took place in Tulsa Oklahoma in 1921 and it
 also started as a reaction to a young black boy who was accused of hurting a white woman and all these murders and writers destroyed Tulsa again if you've never heard about the Tulsa Race Massacre I would highly recommend that after this you should take a moment and educate yourself on what happened I did a full video on it over my YouTube if you want to check that out but I would highly suggest you do research and educate yourself on it too but stories like today
 it showcases Decades of violence with effects that still persist today we need to make sure that we are keeping history honest and transparent because without that we're doomed to repeat it and look it wasn't till freaking 2020 that they started this Foundation to help The Descendants and like yes that's amazing that's incredible and they've been working so hard to get acknowledgement for it but the same time you're like what took them so long you know I think that's a I think that's a great question
 you'll like dr. Edward Gonzalez tenant make sure that the story is kept alive passed on for generations to come and the communities voices are indeed heard he started the Rosewood Heritage in VR project or virtual Rosewood.com if you're curious learn more the link will be in the show credits / description box but this project it's incredible it is dedicated to the Rosewood victims and making sure that their story is never forgotten since our history books seem to have
 left that section out you know these foundations keep the conversation on going by building a movement to build memoriam 's and landmarks even working towards trying to make Rosewood a National Historic Landmark there has been talks about building museums and Exhibits in Florida I mean as they should but for now there's a sign in Rosewood sponsored by the real Rosewood Foundation that does share the horrific events
 that took place in Rosewood in 1923 and that my friends is the horrible awful dark history of the Rosewood Massacre whoo it's heavy huh stories like this can be really uncomfortable you know very uncomfortable but they're important how can we ever learn and grow if we don't know where we've been and the Rosewood Massacre is a fraction of what's been taking place in our country for a very long time in the story notes
